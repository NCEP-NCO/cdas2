Change to r2_ssi (4/2008)


Previously this program used fixed sized arrays to hold observations.  Every 
once in a while, the program would fail because of the number of observations 
would exceed the array size.  Someone would have to up the array size and 
rerun the code.

This revision to the code uses dynamic arrays, so the overflow problem
should never occur again.  I also changed some (but not all) the
loops to f90 style.

This code was compared with the old code, and the results were bit
reproducable except when the old code failed because of the array
overflow.
